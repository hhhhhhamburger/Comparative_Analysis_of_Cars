# Comparative analysis of Cars

This project analyzes data from different cars, focusing on features such as transmission type, color, and more. The workflow includes data processing, statistical modeling, and visualization to help users better understand the distribution and characteristics of cars in the market.

## Project Structure

```

  ├── cars comparison.r      # Additional analysis scripts
  ├── data_processing.R      # Data loading and preprocessing functions
  ├── main.R                 # Main entry point, orchestrates the workflow
  └── plotting.R             # Visualization and plotting functions
```

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Load and clean car data from the source.
- **Modeling:** Perform statistical modeling on car features such as brand, transmission, and color.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots to visualize the distribution and relationships of various car attributes.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Environment**  
   Make sure you have R installed, along with required packages such as `ggplot2` and `dplyr`.

2. **Run the Main Script**  
   In your R environment, execute:
   ```r
   source("main.R")
   ```

3. **View Results**  
   The script will print model summaries and display various plots.

## Dependencies

- `ggplot2` for visualization
- `dplyr` for data manipulation
- (Add any other packages your scripts require)

## File Descriptions

- **main.R:** Main script that runs the analysis pipeline.
- **data_processing.R:** Functions for reading and preprocessing data.
- **plotting.R:** Functions for generating plots and visualizations.
- **cars comparison.r:** Additional or comparative analysis scripts.
